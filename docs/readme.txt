1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Satanic Gameshow Deluxe is a gameplay mod for the classic Doom games, powered
by GZDoom. The mod's core feature set consists of a completely new weapon
arsenal, a "feat"-based weapon upgrade system and finishers a la Wrack.
                                                    
Best played with your megawad of choice.


2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

Satanic Gameshow Deluxe requires GZDoom 3.7.0 at a minimum to run. It is
designed to be played with any commercial Doom IWAD. Compatibility with any
other IWADs is neither guaranteed nor planned.


3. BUILDING/RUNNING THE MOD
===========================

3.1 If you downloaded the mod from ModDB or Dropbox:
----------------------------------------------------
1.	Open sgd_*.zip with your archive manager of choice and extract sgd_*.pk3
	into a folder of your choice. You may also extract any of the .txt files
	if you wish, but they are not necessary for running the mod.
2.	Click on and drag sgd_*.pk3 over gzdoom.exe or use your launcher of choice
	to run the mod. Using a launcher is highly recommended if you want to run
	other mods alongside SGD.

3.2 If you downloaded a ZIP from GitHub:
----------------------------------------
1.	Open sgd_master.zip with your archive manager of choice and extract the
	contents of sgd_master/ within the ZIP to a folder of your choice. NOTE:
	If you're using IZArc or a similar program that has an option to restore
	the original folders, make sure that it's enabled.
2.	With the content of the ZIP extracted, create a new ZIP archive and import
	ALL contents of the folder that was within sgd_master/ into it.
3*.	Open the new ZIP archive in SLADE3 (or another program that allows saving
	archives in .pk3 format) and save it in .pk3 format.

	* This step is optional - GZDoom is capable of running normal .zip archives
	  in place of .pk3 archives, as long as they follow the PK3 structure. See
	  http://zdoom.org/wiki/Using_ZIPs_as_WAD_replacement for more information.


4. REPORTING BUGS
=================

Bugs may be reported by the following means:

E-mail:			H3llraich@yahoo.com
Discord PM:		MFG38#3393
ZDoom project thread:	http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=65490
ModDB page:		http://www.moddb.com/mods/satanic-gameshow-deluxe

If you are sending a bug report by e-mail, please clearly state that you are
doing so in the e-mail subject line. Make sure to add any relevant attachments,
such as screenshots and/or videos, to your bug report regardless of the means
whereby you are submitting it.

Please note that due to changes committed to the GitHub repository being
incremental, builds downloaded and compiled from the repository are not guaranteed
to work as well as the stable builds. For this reason, I'd advise you to only
submit bug reports found in the stable builds, which follow the sgd_*.pk3 naming
convention and can be downloaded from either ModDB or Dropbox.
