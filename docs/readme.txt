1. INTRODUCTION
===============

Satanic Gameshow Deluxe is a gameplay mod for the classic Doom games, powered
by GZDoom. The mod's core feature set consists of a completely new weapon
arsenal, a "feat"-based weapon upgrade system and finishers a la Wrack.

Best played with your megawad of choice.


2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

Satanic Gameshow Deluxe requires GZDoom 4.3.0 at a minimum to run. It is
designed to be played with any commercial Doom IWAD. Compatibility with any
other IWADs is neither guaranteed nor planned.


3. BUILDING/RUNNING THE MOD
===========================

3.1 If you downloaded the mod from ModDB, Google Drive or Dropbox:
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Open sgd_*.zip with your archive manager of choice and extract sgd_v*.pk3
	into a folder of your choice. You may also extract any of the .txt files
	if you wish, but they are not necessary for running the mod.
2.	Click on and drag sgd_v*.pk3 over gzdoom.exe or use your launcher of choice
	to run the mod. If you want to load sgd_v*.pk3 alongside other PWADs, using
	a launcher is highly recommended.

3.2 If you downloaded a ZIP of the source from GitHub:
------------------------------------------------------
1.	Move sgd-master.zip to your folder of choice. DO NOT UNZIP THE ARCHIVE.
2.	Click on and drag sgd-master.zip over gzdoom.exe or use your launcher of
	choice to run the mod. If you want to load sgd-master.zip alongside other
	PWADs, using a launcher is highly recommended.


4. REPORTING BUGS
=================

Bugs may be reported by the following means:

E-mail:					mfg38thelps@aol.com
Discord PM:				MFG38#3393
ZDoom project thread:	http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=65490
ModDB page:				http://www.moddb.com/mods/satanic-gameshow-deluxe

If you are sending a bug report by e-mail, please clearly state that you are
doing so in the e-mail subject line. Make sure to add any relevant attachments,
such as screenshots and/or videos, to your bug report regardless of the means
whereby you are submitting it.

Please note that due to changes committed to the GitHub repository being
incremental, builds downloaded and compiled from the repository are not guaranteed
to work as well as the stable builds. For this reason, I'd advise you to only
submit bug reports found in the stable builds, which follow the sgd_v*.pk3 naming
convention and can be downloaded from either ModDB or Dropbox.
