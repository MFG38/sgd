====================

Satanic Gameshow Deluxe is a mod in which killing matters, especially killing a lot in quick succession.

Acquiring weapon upgrades
-------------------------

In Satanic Gameshow Deluxe, there are weapon upgrades to be acquired - only instead of finding them lying about
or buying them in a shop, you obtain them by killing large numbers of specific demons. The mod has in all 13
different upgrades that are specific to certain weapons. Most weapons have two different upgrades, but some have
only one upgrade or none at all. The upgrades available for each weapon are detailed in the "Weapons" section.

Each upgrade can be acquired by 3 different means. For instance, to acquire the accuracy upgrade for the Rifle,
you have to kill 50 imps, 50 cacodemons or 75 zombiemen. Note that the weapon upgrades don't stack - if you already
have a weapon upgrade, you won't be able to obtain it again.

Performing finishers
--------------------

Upon killing an enemy, you'll obtain a specific number of "finisher tokens". The number of these tokens is dependent
on the relative threat level of the enemy you kill. A bar in the top left corner of the screen will show you how many
finisher tokens you have. Once you have enough finisher tokens, a message will flash at the bottom of the screen,
letting you know that a finisher is ready to use. Press the Altfire button to unleash the finisher.

Note that the finisher tokens decay over time - sitting around is strongly discouraged, lest you miss an opportunity
to rain death upon your enemies! Each weapon (with the exception of the Dark Matter Cannon) has 3 different finishers
with varying levels of lethality. The finisher changes depending on how many finisher tokens you have upon using one.

Also, in case it's somehow not obvious, your finisher tokens get reset upon using a finisher.

= WEAPONS =
===========

Slot 0: Chainsaw
----------------

Range:			Melee
Damage:			Medium
Max. Capacity:		N/A
Available Upgrades:	Damage increase

Finishers:		Level 1: TBD
			Level 2: TBD
			Level 3: TBD

A two-bladed chainsaw sounds quite impractical for its intended purpose, but it's more than ideal for cutting the
flesh and bone of the demonic invaders! This battery-powered, self-recharging "tool" can quickly and efficiently down
almost any oversized pest that gets too close for comfort. And it doesn't even need fuel!

Slot 1: Fists
-------------

Range:			Melee
Damage:			Low
Max. Capacity:		N/A
Available Upgrades:	N/A

Finishers:		Level 1: swift forward kick
			Level 2: forward kick with chain exploder
			Level 3: 5-second time stop

They're your hands. They're sort of puny. 'Nuff said.

Slot 2: Rifle
-------------

Range:			Long
Damage:			Low
Max. Capacity:		150
Available Upgrades:	Accuracy increase
			Fire rate increase

Finishers:		Level 1: TBD
			Level 2: TBD
			Level 3: TBD

A standard-issue weapon for fresh marine recruits, the Rifle is a weapon that's best used to pick off low-tier enemies
in the distance. It doesn't boast any significant firepower, but some creative marines have found ways to improve the
otherwise "weak" armament, effectively turning it into an assault rifle.

Slot 3: Shotgun
---------------

Range:			Close/Medium
Damage:			Medium
Max. Capacity:		80 (shared with Double-Barrel Shotgun)
Available Upgrades:	Range increase
			Spread reduction

Finishers:		Level 1: TBD
			Level 2: TBD
			Level 3: TBD

The Shotgun is the weapon of choice of many marines who favor close-quarters combat. Even the biggest and baddest demons
flinch at the hole this boomstick makes into their chests. Many marines, however, have complained at the Shotgun's high
spread, and some have even modified their "lovelies" to tighten their spread, as well as boost their range slightly.

Slot 4: Double-Barrel Shotgun
-----------------------------

Range:			Close
Damage:			High
Max. Capacity:		80 (shared with Shotgun)
Available Upgrades:	Recoil reduction
			Reload speed increase

Finishers:		Level 1: TBD
			Level 2: TBD
			Level 3: TBD

Despite its sheer firepower, the Double-Barrel Shotgun is rarely seen in the hands of UAC marines. One has to wonder why,
considering the weapon is capable of downing even large demons with a single shot. Maybe it has something to do with the
high spread and the recoil...

Slot 5: Minigun
---------------

Range:			Medium
Damage:			Medium
Max. Capacity:		500
Available Upgrades:	Accuracy increase
			Windup time reduction

Finishers:		Level 1: 3-bullet rapid fire attack
			Level 2: 5-bullet rapid fire attack
			Level 3: 7-bullet rapid fire attack

Though cumbersome and difficult to use efficiently, the Minigun is another popular choice in the UAC's arsenal of demon-
slaying equipment. It is quite slow to "warm up", but once it does, the stream of hot lead that this 6-barreled monster
spits out is enough to make the most frightening hellspawn run away in fear - if it can even make it to the Gate before
its legs get ripped to shreds. Some models come fitted with additional components to hasten the windup and increase
accuracy.

Slot 6: Bazooka
---------------

Range:			Long
Damage:			High
Max. Capacity:		45
Available Upgrades:	Fire rate increase
			Recoil reduction

Finishers:		Level 1: volley of 3 homing rockets
			Level 2: volley of 5 homing rockets
			Level 3: air strike (works best when aimed at the ground)

One of the few explosive-based weapons from UAC's armory, the Bazooka fires micro-nukes powerful enough to make a
cyberdemon flinch. Using it takes some strong legs, however, as the recoil can easily knock a less fit marine on their
butt. Ways have been found to eliminate the recoil entirely, though, and some more tech-savvy marines have even modified
their bazookas to turn them into almost fully automatic rocket-spitters, the usefulness of which has been strongly
debated.

Slot 7: Flamethrower
--------------------

Range:			Medium
Damage:			Medium
Max. Capacity:		450
Available Upgrades:	Lingering flames

Finishers:		Level 1: flame wall
			Level 2: sentient heat-seeking flame wall with "afterburner"
			Level 3: TBD

What happens when you combine the tracing technology of the BFG-9000 and literal fire? This experimental flamethrower.
What the UAC were thinking when they developed this weapon, no one will ever know - not that the marines are complaining.
In fact, a lot of them seem to enjoy shooting sentient, heat-seeking flames at hellspawn.

Slot 8: Argent Rifle
--------------------

Range:			Long
Damage:			Medium
Max. Capacity:		N/A
Available Upgrades:	Faster cooldown

Finishers:		Level 1: laser beam
			Level 2: 3 spread laser beams
			Level 3: Argent bomb

An experiment by the UAC in utilizing Argent Energy in weapons, this prototype weapon is similar in its function
to the Plasma Gun. Primarily, it fires concentrated bolts of Argent Energy at high speeds, but it can also shoot
deadly Argent lasers or spit out large globs of Argent Energy that explode like bombs, dealing significant damage
to anything organic in its area of impact. The Argent Rifle is a powerful and versatile weapon, but it has a
drawback - it's quick to overheat and slow to cool down.

Slot 9: Dark Matter Cannon
--------------------------

Range:			Long
Damage:			High
Max. Capacity:		3
Available Upgrades:	N/A

Finishers:		N/A

As if the BFG-9000 wasn't enough, the UAC found a way to manipulate antimatter and weaponize it. The Dark Matter
Cannon shoots antimatter projectiles that turn into black holes upon collision with a surface, absorbing and
evaporating anything organic that happens within its radius. If aimed well, it can even evaporate a cyberdemon
with relative ease. However, the weapon's charge is extremely limited, allowing only a few uses before needing
a refill.


============
= POWERUPS =
============

Demonizer Orb
-------------
The Demonizer Orb is a demonic artifact that turns you into a near-unstoppable killing machine for 60 seconds.
When you use the Demonizer, you become immune to almost all damage (except Holy Water), your movement speed
increases by 20%, and your fists get supercharged to the point where you can take down a Cyberdemon with only a
few swift punches. Unfortunately, the benefit is only temporary, and you're unable to pick up most items while
under the effect of the Demonizer.

Field Med Pack
--------------
Similar in functionality to the Portable Medkit from Duke Nukem 3D, the Field Med Pack can provide a boost when
you need it the most. You can use the Field Med Pack whenever your health is under 100% to boost yourself back to
life. The appropriate amount will get subtracted from the Field Med Pack's health pool. If the points are not
sufficient for a full boost, you'll get healed up to where the Field Med Pack runs out of juice, so to speak.

Hazmat Suit
-----------
When you need to slog through a river of acidic ooze, put on a Hazmat Suit and come out the other end (relatively)
unscathed. 'Nuff said.

Holy Water Grenade
------------------
Although it looks like an ordinary potion of blue liquid, the Holy Water Grenade is a rather useful armament, great
for crowd control. Toss one of these at the feet of a group of demons and watch them get effectively stun-locked as
the pool of water beneath kills them slowly. The Holy Water Grenade is best used in situations where groups of enemies
are closing in from several directions - slow down one group with a pool of holy water while you pump the other full
of hot lead!

Light Amp Goggles
-----------------
The Light Amp Goggles let you see clearly in dark areas. Put them on whenever you can't see and witness the wonder of
clear sight! They can also be put away when they're not needed. Do note that they have limited battery, though!
